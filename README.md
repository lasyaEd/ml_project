### This notebook trains and evaluates a Siamese neural network.

At a high level, the notebook performs the following:

**Loads and preprocesses data**: It reads labeled image data from a CSV file (/content/flow_image_labeled_data.csv). This data likely consists of pairs of images (Flow_Image1, Flow_Image2) and a label indicating whether the pair represents a "match cut" (visually similar frames) or not. The images are preprocessed (resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized) and saved as NumPy arrays for efficient use by the neural network.

**Splits data into training and testing sets**: The loaded data is split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.

**Builds and trains a Siamese network**: A Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture particularly suited for tasks involving similarity comparison, like match cut detection. The notebook constructs this network using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture involves a shared convolutional base network followed by a distance calculation layer (measuring the difference between the feature embeddings of the two input images) and a final sigmoid layer for binary classification (match cut or not). The network is then trained using the preprocessed training data.

**Evaluates the trained model**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test data set, reporting the test loss and accuracy.

**Makes predictions and visualizes results**: The trained model makes predictions on the test image pairs, producing similarity scores. The notebook then provides code to visualize a few example image pairs alongside their predicted similarity scores, allowing for visual inspection of the model's performance. Finally, it generates accuracy and loss plots from the training process.


**Reproduce the results**: The notebook is a self-contained, reproducible workflow. Given the same input data, you can run the notebook to obtain the same model and results. However, you'll need to have the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and matplotlib) installed and the CSV data file available. The notebook also assumes a Google Colab environment (indicated by drive.mount usage), but could be adapted to run elsewhere.

### This Python script is a Streamlit application that performs match cutting on YouTube videos. Match cutting is a film editing technique where similar actions or shots are juxtaposed to create a seamless transition or highlight a thematic connection.

At a high level, the application does the following:

**Downloads a pre-trained Siamese network:** It uses the huggingface_hub library to download a pre-trained model (likely for image similarity comparison) from Hugging Face.

**Gets YouTube video frames**: The user provides a YouTube video ID. The app downloads the video, extracts frames at a specified interval, and stores them.

**Allows selection of a reference section**: The user selects a portion (a range of frames) of the video to serve as the reference section for comparison.

**Finds similar sections**: Using the pre-trained Siamese network, the application compares the reference section with other sections of the video to identify sections with visually similar content. The similarity is based on frame-by-frame comparison.

**Displays results**: The application displays the selected reference section and the top similar sections it found, along with their similarity scores. These are shown as short video clips.

In short, you would use this application if you need to automatically find visually similar sections within a YouTube video, potentially for film editing purposes, analysis of visual patterns, or other tasks requiring visual similarity detection. The use of a pre-trained Siamese network allows it to perform this task without needing extensive training data.
