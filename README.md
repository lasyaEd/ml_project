###This notebook trains and evaluates a Siamese neural network.

At a high level, the notebook performs the following:

**Loads and preprocesses data**: It reads labeled image data from a CSV file (/content/flow_image_labeled_data.csv). This data likely consists of pairs of images (Flow_Image1, Flow_Image2) and a label indicating whether the pair represents a "match cut" (visually similar frames) or not. The images are preprocessed (resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized) and saved as NumPy arrays for efficient use by the neural network.

**Splits data into training and testing sets**: The loaded data is split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.

**Builds and trains a Siamese network**: A Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture particularly suited for tasks involving similarity comparison, like match cut detection. The notebook constructs this network using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture involves a shared convolutional base network followed by a distance calculation layer (measuring the difference between the feature embeddings of the two input images) and a final sigmoid layer for binary classification (match cut or not). The network is then trained using the preprocessed training data.

**Evaluates the trained model**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test data set, reporting the test loss and accuracy.

**Makes predictions and visualizes results**: The trained model makes predictions on the test image pairs, producing similarity scores. The notebook then provides code to visualize a few example image pairs alongside their predicted similarity scores, allowing for visual inspection of the model's performance. Finally, it generates accuracy and loss plots from the training process.


**Reproduce the results**: The notebook is a self-contained, reproducible workflow. Given the same input data, you can run the notebook to obtain the same model and results. However, you'll need to have the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and matplotlib) installed and the CSV data file available. The notebook also assumes a Google Colab environment (indicated by drive.mount usage), but could be adapted to run elsewhere.
